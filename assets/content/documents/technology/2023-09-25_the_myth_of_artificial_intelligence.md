# The Myth of Artificial Intelligence

ChatGPT and similar apps are exciting.  There is a hidden secret
that is not being discussed.  The secret is that the AI is not
intelligent.  It is a trick.  It is built around plagiarism.  It
steals from the internet.  It is a glorified search engine.

Anything you post on the internet is fair game for ChatGPT to
steal and use in its responses.  Publishing your source code on github
or posting your images online could result in your content being used
by ChatGPT.  If you are a photographer, you could find your images
being used by ChatGPT.  If you are a writer, you could find your
articles being used by ChatGPT.

Users of ChatGPT are not aware of the source of the content.  They
are not aware that the content is being stolen from the internet.

An excellent example of this is that ChatGPT wrote most of this article. 
Which means someone else wrote it first.

In the future, AI tools will study worker productivity and then
automate their jobs.  First as an enhancement and later as a replacement.
There is a role for AI in the future, but it is not the role that
is being advertised today.
