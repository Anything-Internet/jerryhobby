When it comes to business technology, every company has unique 
challenges specific how they produce their products and take 
care of their customers.  Modern companies rely on advanced 
technologies and look forward to the value from 
AI (artificial intelligence).  Most companies have no idea how to 
apply these technologies to their current business practices.

A well-designed technology infrastructure includes tools to 
manage products and customers with as much of it automated 
as possible and with as many business policies and processes 
managed with advanced software solutions.

My experience has focused on these types of solutions. 
As a software developer, as an infrastructure engineer, 
and as a project manager.  The benefit of these types of solutions 
is to provide consistent results to the customer as quickly as possible.

As a consultant, developer, and technological though-leader, 
I can help your company address some of these issues.
